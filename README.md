# network-inference-scripts
A collection of Julia scripts for working with inferred gene regulatory networks. 

Requires the NetworkInference package (https://github.com/Tchanders/NetworkInference.jl) 

### Warning: this repo is a direct dump of my working folder, so expect a LOT of hardcoding
(Especially file paths inside the scripts, which will need to be changed to where you store your data)
